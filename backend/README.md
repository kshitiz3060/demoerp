# ERP Backend Starter (FastAPI Microservices)

This is a starter template generated by ChatGPT for a FastAPI-based microservices backend to pair with your frontend components.
It includes services:
- api_gateway
- auth_service
- student_service
- academic_service
- exam_service
- shared (common utilities)
- docker-compose for local dev (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ)

## Quick start (development)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update secrets.
2. Run `docker-compose up --build` to start services (Postgres, Redis, RabbitMQ and the FastAPI services).
3. Services expose ports:
   - API Gateway: 8000
   - Auth Service: 8001
   - Student Service: 8002
   - Academic Service: 8003
   - Exam Service: 8004

## Notes
- JWT secret is shared via environment variable `JWT_SECRET` for simplicity. In production, use a secrets manager.
- Each service uses its own PostgreSQL schema but for dev docker-compose uses a single Postgres instance.
- This starter focuses on structure and auth + example endpoints. Extend models and routes to match your frontend needs.
